DCodelessLanguageModule.plist is a simple syntax highlighter for the "D Programming Language" that can be used in either BBEdit or its free version, TextWrangler.

Installation:
BBEdit: copy the plist to "~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules"
TextWrangler: copy the plist to "~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules"

Then launch either app and goto "Preferences" -> "Languages" and then add the suffix mapping for the "D Programming Language" by setting the suffix to d (di too if you want)

-- BUG --
nested { for Token strings break highlighting. 
Example:
writeln(q{ foo(q{hello}); }); // will stop highlight at first }
These are dumb plists files so there will probably never be a fix.
*WORKAROUND: escape each nested } then remove escapes after final } is in place...
